# MetaBorg Homebrew Tap

To install MetaBorg formulas with Homebrew, add this tap with

    brew tap metaborg/metaborg

Now install Stratego/XT with

    brew install strategoxt

## Notes for Linux

You can use this way on linux as well, if you install the Homebrew clone
Linuxbrew (https://github.com/Homebrew/linuxbrew) using the instructions in
their GitHub repository.

If `brew install` complains that it has no compiler to use, try to pass one
explicitly on the commandline, as in: ```brew install strategoxt --cc=gcc-4.9```
